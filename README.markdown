``` ruby
Factory.define :user do |f|
  f.login 'johndoe%d'                          # Sequence.
  f.email '%{login}@example.com'               # Interpolate.
  f.password f.password_confirmation('foobar') # Chain.
end

Factory.define :post do |f|
  f.user { Factory :user }                     # Blocks, if you must.
end
```


## Install

``` sh
$ gem install miniskirt
```

In a Rails ~> 3 project:

``` ruby
# Gemfile
group :test do
  gem 'miniskirt'
end
```

``` sh
$ bundle
```

``` ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
require 'factories' # If you define your factories in test/factories.rb
```


## Use

To get a `User` instance that's not saved:

``` ruby
u = Factory.build :user
```

To get a `User` instance that's saved:

``` ruby
u = Factory.create :user
```

Shorthand for create:

``` ruby
u = Factory :user
```


### Methods

Methods can customize a factory's object as it is being built.

Take a simple class:

``` ruby
class User
  attr_accessor :name
  attr_accessor :email
end
```

And a simple factory:

``` ruby
Factory.define :user do
end
```

Use:

``` ruby
u = Factory :user, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com'
u.name  # => "Alice"
u.email # => "alice@example.com"
```

This initializes the object, then calls the object's `name=` method and
`email=` method.


### Blocks

Blocks can use any Ruby code:

``` ruby
Factory.define :user do |f|
  f.name { %w[Alice Bob Carol].choice }
  f.email { "#{%w[alice bob carol].choice}@example.com" }
end
```

Use:

``` ruby
u = Factory :user
u.name  # => "Bob"
u.email # => "carol@example.com"
```

Blocks can use a parameter to access the object as it is being built:

``` ruby
Factory.define :user do |f|
  f.name { %w[Alice Bob Carol].choice }
  f.email { |u| "#{u.name.downcase}@example.com" }
end
```

Use:

``` ruby
u = Factory :user
u.name  # => "Bob"
u.email # => "bob@example.com"
```


### Methods + Blocks

When you use methods and blocks together, the methods are called, then the
blocks:

``` ruby
user = Factory :user, name: 'Eve'
user.name  # => "Eve"
user.email # => "eve@example.com"
```

This initializes the object, then calls the object's `name=` method, then
processes the factory attribute `email` which calls the block.
